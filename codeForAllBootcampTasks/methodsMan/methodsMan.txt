<Methods Man...>
We can best help you to prevent war not by repeating your words and following your methods but by finding new words and creating new methods.
VIRGINIA WOOLF, Three Guineas, 1938

When we learned about functions a few exercises back we saw it is possible to store a function in a variable, and to invoke it by accessing that variable. Let's look at the relation between functions and objects.

var notAHero = {
    fullName: 'Peter Parker',
    age: 23,
    job: 'Photographer',
    takePicture: function () {
        console.log('Click. Great pic!');
    }
};

We are creating an object with typical key-value pairs. Notice how the value associated with the key takePicture is a function. 

When a function is stored inside of an object we call it a method. Methods represent the behaviors or functionalities of our object. Much like a property is what an object has, a method is what an object does.

So how do we invoke a method? We can access it using it's key, much like we did when accessing properties. Then all we need to invoke it is to add parenthesis, just like you would invoke a function which is stored in a variable!

notAHero.takePicture();
// prints 'Click. Great pic!'

Show me the code!

Create an object named wizard. Add a method named makeSpell to the wizard object that will print any message you want to the console. 

Add another method named playQuidditch that also prints a message.

Invoke both methods.
