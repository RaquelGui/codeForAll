In the strings section of this challenge we saw how strings have in-built functionality, which allows us to perform operations on strings. The same is true for arrays. Here's a couple of things we can do with an array:

var petShop = [ 'Puppies', 'Kitties', 'Hamsters', 'Bunnies', 'Birds' ];

petShop.pop();
console.log(petShop);    // prints ["Puppies","Kitties","Hamsters","Bunnies"]

petShop.push('Piglets');
console.log(petShop);    // prints ["Puppies","Kitties","Hamsters","Bunnies","Piglets"]

In the snippet above we can see two array methods in action: push() and pop().

As we can see the pop() method removes the last element from the array, while the push() method adds the element passed as argument to the end of the array.

Show me the Code!

Using the methods you have learned, modify the xMen array already declared in the editor so that only members of the X-Men are present.

Then add all of the mutants present in the xMen array to the freelancers array.
