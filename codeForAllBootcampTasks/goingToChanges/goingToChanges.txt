<Going through Changes>
Your old road is rapidly agin''. Please get out of the new one, for the times they are a-changin'.

Of course we might want to change the value stored in an object's property. Let's use the object we have been analising these last exercises to see how.

var notAHero = {
    fullName: 'Peter Parker',
    job: 'Photographer',
    age: 23
};

We can change the value associated with a key. As we can see below by using dot notation to access the property, and then using the assignment operator to store a new value in that property.

notAHero.job = 'Photographer/Super Hero';
notAHero.age = 24;

Let's take a look at how these changes affected the state of the object by printing it to the console.

console.log(notAHero);
// prints {fullName: "Peter Parker", job: "Photographer/Super Hero", age: 24}

Pro-Tip: If you try to assign a value to a property which does not yet exist in the object, a new property with that name will be added to the object.

Show me the Code!

Reassign the nickname property of the wizard object to have the value of 'the chosen one'.

Finally, print the wizard object.
