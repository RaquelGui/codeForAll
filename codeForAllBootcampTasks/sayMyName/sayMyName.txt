<Say my name>
Do you know why hurricanes have names instead of numbers? To keep the killing personal. No one cares about a bunch of people killed by a number.

As we saw in the last exercise, data is organised in objects as properties, which are key-value pairs. To access the value stored in a property we can use dot notation. Access a variable by it's name, followed by a dot and then the property name.

For example if we wanted to access the value of the property age of the object stored in the variable notAHero we would use dot notation.

console.log(notAHero.age);
// prints 23

We access the object using the name of the variable where it is stored, and then access a property by using a dot and the name of the key corresponding to that property.

Be aware that trying to access a property which doesn't exist returns undefined.

console.log(notAHero.superPower);
// prints undefined

Pro-Tip: remember when we used 'hello'.length to know the size of a string? We could do that because strings have a property called length which stores the number of characters in that string.

Show me the code!

Using the dot notation, access the given object so you can print the string 'Harry Potter, the boy who lived'.
