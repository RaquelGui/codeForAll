<Handling the truth>
Do. Or do not. There is no try.
YODA, The Empire Strikes Back, 1980

We've finally got to the JavaScript value your computer understands best above all. The boolean. 

Contrary to numbers or strings, which can assume billions of different values, the boolean comes with the great comfort of having two and only two possibilities:
Yes or no; on or off; true or false; one or zero; do or do not.

It just takes one question to be sure which boolean value a variable is holding. Are you not on? Then you must be off.

The literal representation of these two values in JavaScript is the following:

true
false

Just like that, no quotes whatsoever. If you need to assign a boolean value to a variable, this is how you'll do it:

var myBoolean = true;

Don't underestimate the power of a simple true or false statement. The world of computation is built upon binary logic. 

Now the real fun begins.

Show me the code!

Why don't you go ahead and try to assign boolean values to the declared variables.
