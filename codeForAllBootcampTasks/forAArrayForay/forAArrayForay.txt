<For an Array Foray>
Not all those who wander are lost.
J. R. R. TOLKIEN, The Fellowship of the Ring, 1954

Now that you know all about arrays we can start relating them to what we already learned about loops.

For example, accessing and printing every element of an array is a very repetitive task. Which can be achieved using a for loop. In the snippet below we iterate through the array petShop and print to the console each of the elements of the array.

var petShop = ['Puppies', 'Kitties', 'Hamsters', 'Bunnies', 'Birds'];

console.log('In the shop we have the following animals:');

for (var i = 0; i < petShop.length; i++) {
     console.log(petShop[i]);
}

With each iteration we access the element of index i of the array and print it. As the value of i increments with each iteration (until it reaches the length of the array), every element of the array will be printed.

Show me the Code!

Iterate over the array provided in powerRangers and print to the console a string that shows the elements' index and the content of the element.
e.g.: '0: Red'
