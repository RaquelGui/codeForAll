<Give me the words>
What about getting a single string from an array of strings?

var randomWords = [‘There’, ‘must’, ‘be’, ‘a’, ‘better’, ‘way’];

Once again you already have the tools to go through each string with a loop and with the + operator concatenate each word within a new string.

var randomWords = ['There', 'must', 'be', 'a', 'better', 'way'];
var sentence = '';

for (var i = 0; i < randomWords.length; i++) {
    sentence += randomWords[i];
  
    if(i < randomWords.length - 1) {
        sentence += ' '; // add a space as a word separator
    }
}

But by now you should be noticing a pattern. Yes, there’s a method.

JavaScript arrays are built with a method join, which produces a string from an array of strings. Once again, you must specify a separator. If you don’t, a comma will be used between each string:

var phrase = randomWords.join();
console.log(phrase); // prints 'There,must,be,a,better,way'

This probably isn’t the intended result for this string, but you could pass a string with a space character as an argument to the join method to solve this.

<Show me the Code>
Use the join method on the given array to produce the string There must be a better way
And then go ahead and print your new string.
