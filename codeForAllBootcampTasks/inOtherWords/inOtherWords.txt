<In other words...>
When you read, don't just consider what the author thinks, consider what you think.
JOHN KEATING, Dead Poets Society, 1989

The same way you've had built-in functionality to work with numbers through the Math object, JavaScript also provides you with some actions you can use with strings.

Except in this case you won't have a special object like Math, you'll be calling this functionality directly on the string value. These actions (as well as the Math ones) are called methods. 

Let's take a look at some of them:

var mrKeating = 'Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys.'
var shouting = mrKeating.toUpperCase(); // we're creating a copy of mrKeating string with all characters in upper case, but we are not changing the original!
var whispering = mrKeating.toLowerCase(); // same, for lower case. Original remains untouched

This is useful when you're dealing with a string provided to you by the user but you don't care about case sensitivity. Also when dealing with user input, it's sometimes useful to ignore whitespace from both ends of a string.

JavaScript is so kind as to offer you a way to do this with another method:

var carelessInput = '           Good evening, Clarice.             '
var trimmedInput = carelessInput.trim(); // this will also create a new string with all the unnecessary spaces removed, and assign it to the trimmedInput variable. The original? Not touched.

Show me the code!

Without modifying the original, transform the string to print the famous quote oh captain, my captain.
