<Hacking Task #3>
One of your accomplices was able to physically steal a hard drive from one of fSociety's targets, however the victim had safeguards in place and was able to corrupt the data on the disk.

Now back in the arcade you have been tasked with recovering the jumbled data, which is central to fSociety's next big play.

You can leave the data on the disk as it is , but you should be able to copy it to a new hard drive, and be able to print it.

Instructions

Copy the uncorrupted data in the array stored in targetDisk to the empty array newDisk (corrupted data looks like this: Ã¸). Then print the contents of the disk to the terminal as a string.

To complete this task remember the arrays' methods we have learned so far.
