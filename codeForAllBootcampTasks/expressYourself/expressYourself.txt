<Express yourself>

You saw what happens when dealing with number 9 or any other number. We say number 9 is a value, and so are all other numbers.
Javascript also provides some arithmetic operators which allow you to create an expression.

2 + 9;

An expression always produces a value, in this case the number 11, which will take the place of the entire expression once calculated.

10 + 1;

This is a completely different expression from the one before but they both produce the same value, which is the number 11.

Expressions are not very useful on their own and we commonly use them inside statements. In the snippet below we have a console.log statement which receives an expression. JavaScript will start by resolving the expression to a value and only then will console.log do its work.

console.log(2 + 9 + 3 + 8);
   


 
<Show me the code>
Write four statements that all print 42 to the console, using four different expressions.
