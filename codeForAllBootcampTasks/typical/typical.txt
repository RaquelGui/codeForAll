<Typical...>
In order to be irreplaceable one must first be different.

It has been said that a computer program is only the ability to store and manipulate data. So far we have learned about some of data types available in JavaScript: Number, String and Boolean.

However in the last section we were introduced to a different data type: undefined. The value undefined represents the unintentional absence of a value. It's defined by the keyword undefined.

Another data type you will come across is null, which represents the intentional absence of a value. It is defined by the keyword null.
JavaScript offers us an operator which used before a variable will return the type of data stored in that variable. This operator is called typeof and here's an example of how to use it:

var slogan = 'To infinity and beyond!';
var helmetOn = true;
console.log(slogan + ' is a ' + typeof slogan);
// prints 'To infinity and beyond! is a string'
console.log(helmetOn + ' is a ' + typeof helmetOn);
// prints 'true is a boolean'

Show me the Code!

Declare a variable named soTypical. Assign it with a value of your choice and print the variable's type to the console.
