<Any comments?>
You talking to me?
TRAVIS BICKLE, Taxi Driver, 1976

Sometimes you'll feel the need to add some notes, reminders, or just a brief explanation of what you're trying to achieve with the code you've just written. In JavaScript these are called comments, and you have two ways of defining them:

Single Line comment
// This line is a comment
console.log('Hello, friend');
console.log('Hello, friend'); // this is a comment
Multi-line comment
/*
Anything inside this multi-line comment
console.log('Hello');
console.log('World');
will be ignored and will not be executed.
*/
The machine will ignore your comments, but the person reading your code won't (hopefully).

 



Show me the code!
Let’s practice adding some code comments. 
To the right, we’ve provided you with an excerpt from a series written by a famous hacker, Aaron Swartz, titled  Raw Nerve. On line 1, write a single line comment that states Thoughts on Getting Better.
Use a multi-line comment so that the console.log statements on lines 2 - 8 are commented out.
